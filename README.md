# GetImagesMagicMirror
created a small .net  core web app to serve images to magic mirror to have images in the div background 
Hi  there
I really liked the Magic mirror project and tried to add my nass iamges slied show as module, 
i quickly realized i have too many raw images and browesers wont let me show those images so i tried to make a small appilicatio that will convert raw to jpeg and
show all the images in randone order. looking at that i saw i only had let calander and weather from the magic mirror as i am more confertabel with .net core so i made/extended
this application to be a subset of magi mirror. it has few components for styling i took from Magic mirror and developed some backend code to deal with data retrival now its a 
small web applocation that can show you your calanders, weather and images from a location you have access to and i only show jepeg and Nikon Nef images but its filterd in the code you can use the extension that works for you as its using 
Magick to do the image minupulation.

the overall driving factor is orignal Magic Mirror application thanks to
